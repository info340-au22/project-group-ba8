        <h2>Problem Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Joining events could be an exciting thing to many people. 
            We are social animals and we need various events to meet 
            friends or intake some joyful air. However, planning events 
            can be problematic. You and your friends decided to have dinner 
            at Juan's Restaurant, but it turns out that there're 3 Juan's 
            Restaurants in town. You planned to go to a concert after 
            visiting your uncle, but it turns out that there's no direct 
            public transit between the two places which you expect would 
            only take a 20-minute bus ride. You occasionally got a discounted 
            weekend trip to Hawaii, but it turns out that all travel guidelines 
            online extends 4-day long at minimum.
        </p>
        <p>
            We had too much headache when managing events neatly and clearly. 
            There are plenty solutions on the market, but non of them provides an 
            integrated experience from the start to the end of an event. We have 
            <a class="links" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-to-do-list-app?rtc=1" target="_blank">Microsoft ToDo</a>, 
            a todo list sharable with friends, but it's good only for brief tasks 
            instead of comprehensive events. We have various social apps, where we 
            can share plans and links with each other, but we need to jump back and 
            forth between apps if you have multiple links. We also have 
            <a class="links" href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/" target="_blank">Tripadvisor</a> 
            which has a robust ecosystem for travel management, but it falls short 
            if you made your own events. These platforms also have strong risks of 
            fake content that deceives users, 
            <a class="links" href="#forbes">said by Forbes</a>. 
            Moreover, one can cost a lot of time traversing through different platforms 
            to collect and write down information of an event, or a poorly informed event 
            could cost time of the attendees. Integrating the experience into one platform 
            could be a life-saver.
