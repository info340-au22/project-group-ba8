        <h2>Problem Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Joining events could be an exciting thing to many people. 
            We are social animals and we need various events to meet 
            friends or intake some joyful air. However, planning events 
            can be problematic. You and your friends decided to have dinner 
            at a nice restaurant, but there are too many in town. You planned to go to a concert that you have want to go for a long time
            , but you have an appointment with your doctor ten mintues after the last song ends. Guess who cannot still until the final song. 
            You occasionally got a discounted weekend trip to Hawaii, but online travel guidelines are long and boring to read. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We had too much headache when managing events neatly and clearly. 
            There are plenty solutions on the market, but non of them provides an 
            integrated experience from the start to the end of an event. We have 
            <a class="links" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-to-do-list-app?rtc=1" target="_blank">Microsoft ToDo</a>, 
            a todo list sharable with friends, but it's good only for brief tasks 
            instead of comprehensive events. We have various social apps, where we 
            can share plans and links with each other, but we need to jump back and 
            forth between apps if you have multiple links and there are lots of useless information. We also have 
            <a class="links" href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/" target="_blank">Tripadvisor</a> 
            which has a robust ecosystem for travel management, but it falls short 
            if you made your own events. These platforms also have strong risks of 
            fake content that deceives users, 
            <a class="links" href="#forbes">said by Forbes</a>. 
            Moreover, one can cost a lot of time traversing through different platforms 
            to collect and write down information of an event, or a poorly informed event 
            could cost time of the attendees. Integrating the experience into one platform 
            could be a life-saver.
